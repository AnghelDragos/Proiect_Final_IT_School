# IT School final exam project
An application should be created that manages airplane tickets for users. Commands will be read from a file called input.txt, and all messages will be written to the output.txt file (on a separate line each). These files will be in the resources folder.

Application function
The application will allow a user to register. They will need to use a unique, unused email address. They also need to have a password of at least 8 characters, which they must confirm. If these conditions are met, the user will be added to the application's collection of users. However, only one user can use the application at a time. To do this, they will need to log in using the correct credentials. If they are successful in connecting, they will be able to view their flights, add new flights, or cancel them. In addition to these actions, all flights can be viewed, new flights can be added, or some can be deleted. When a flight is deleted, all users who had a ticket will be notified and the flight will be removed. In addition, there will be two commands that allow the data held in the application in two tables: users and flights.

There is also a bonus class with 6 unimplemented methods, which expose various statistics of the application.
